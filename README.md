This project tracks the cumulative net flow of POL tokens between the Polygon network and known Binance addresses.

It:

Listens to new Polygon blocks in real-time

Stores raw transaction data in SQLite

Calculates net inflow/outflow of POL tokens into Binance

Prints live updates to the console

🚀 Features

🔗 Connects to Polygon RPC in real time

🏦 Detects transactions involving Binance addresses

💾 Stores data in SQLite (polygon_data.db)

📈 Tracks cumulative net flow of POL tokens

⚡ Live real-time updates

⚙️ Setup & Installation

POL_TOKEN=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010

▶️ Running the Indexer

Start real-time tracking:

cargo run --bin main


This will:

Connect to Polygon RPC

Listen for new blocks

Detect Binance-related transactions

Save data into SQLite
